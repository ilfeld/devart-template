This project has made me an open source advocate. Open source stands in opposition to proprietary software which cannot be interpreted by thehuman eye. 
Indeed, reading through a file of any proprietary software is like sifting through a binarysoup, whereas even a non-programmer can grasp some of the textual significance of code that is writtenat an ASCII level, since this code level is on par with the standard print technology that we have become accustomed to.

On a similar note, I like the idea of keeping this web-app text based so that even the visual output is a bunch of text such that everything is transparent.

On a side note, this is the welcome screen, which asks the user to enter some text that corresponds to an address.
