I've had a major breakthrough! In order to complete the Panopticon, it is necessary for the user to be seen.
So I created a Flash script that turns on the webcam and shows the user himself/herself in a multiplicity of little screens.
These screens can be moved around via the mouse, and generate a playful interaction.
