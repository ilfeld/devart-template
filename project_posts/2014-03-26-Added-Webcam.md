In order to complete the Panopticon, I thought it could be cool for the user to be seen.
So I created a script that turns on the webcam and shows the user himself/herself in a multiplicity of little screens.

These screens can be moved around via the mouse, and generate a playful interaction. However, part of me feels like this isn't necessary and that the web app should just be one page with the Wikipedia results. I'll play around and see how it goes.

I'm curious to see just how people interact with this site, and what types of emotions it elicits.
