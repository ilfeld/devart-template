The project is finally complete!
I added a uniquely generated abstract image that is inspired by the GPS coordinates of a given location.
Wow! I've learnt a lot from this project and have had a great time!

The code for the image works in javascript by generating a gradient with variables that pseudo-random with the randomness seed impacted by the longitude(seed 1) and lattitude(seed 2). This also guarantees that the same image will reappear if the page is refreshed.
