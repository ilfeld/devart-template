It's taken a lot of time to program in python a script that finds the most popular Wikipedia articles within a particular geographic location based on the amount of views that each article receives per month. Learning how to use Google's App Engine and create my first web app was fairly straightforward, and by using Google's Geocoding API, I was able to get a GPS coordinate from any address and feed that into the python script that is hosted on Google App Engine. Next, I'd like to find a playful way to visualize the info.
